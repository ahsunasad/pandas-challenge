    "#Summary of analysis:\n",
    "# Overall, the analysis of the data gives us worthwile insight into what schools had the best average math passing rates, reading average rates, \n",
    "#and overall passing rates. We can look at key factors such as school type and budget to determine if there is a correlation between\n",
    "#these factors (for example, is a higher budget correlated with higher overall passing rate?) \n",
    "\n",
    "#Two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:\n",
    "#1. One conclusion based on the data is that despite not having the highest budget, Pena High School had the highest overall passing rate.\n",
    "#This suggests that budget alone does not determine a school's overall passing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. One comparison based on the data is that charter schools tended to have higher overall passing rates compared to district schools.\n",
    "#We can observe this based on the top 8 highest performing schools all being charter schools. "
