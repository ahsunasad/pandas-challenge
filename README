This project contains attempt for the Module 4 challenge "pandas-challenge", using data for schools and students. The Jupyter notebook is named "Module4"

Analysis is located in the bottom comments of the Jupyter notebook file, but for clarity of reading, I have also added the analysis and conclusions/comparisons below:

Summary of analysis:
Overall, the analysis of the data gives us worthwile insight into what schools had the best average math passing rates, reading average rates, and overall passing rates. 
We can look at key factors such as school type and budget to determine if there is a correlation between these factors (for example, is a higher budget correlated with higher overall passing rate?) 

Two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:
#1. One conclusion based on the data is that despite not having the highest budget, Pena High School had the highest overall passing rate.
This suggests that budget alone does not determine a school's overall passing rate.

2. One comparison based on the data is that charter schools tended to have higher overall passing rates compared to district schools.
We can observe this based on the top 8 highest performing schools all being charter schools.
